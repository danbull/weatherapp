# 5 day forecast app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

After cloning the repo run `yarn install` and then `npm start` by default the app will run on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## TODO (when I have more time)

- Add Redux for state management
- Add SSR
- Improve/refactor chunking weather data into arrays
- Create a daily summary for each day and show 3-hourly details on click
- Test all the things!
